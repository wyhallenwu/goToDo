# goToDo
a terminal todo list implemented in golang. Inspired by todo.txt-cli

- [x] design project layout  
- [x] two files (1)todo (2)done  
- [x] refactor the two files to json format
- [x] build functions to handle files(read, insert, show)
- [x] refactor codes
- [x] create procedure flow
- [x] add project attribute for each todo item
- [ ] modify command parse to be more operation-friendly
- [ ] add new create item method which needs less command(currently need to 
create and then add project attribute)
- [ ] add config.yml to make goToDo can be customized
